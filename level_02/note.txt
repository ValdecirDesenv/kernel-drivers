This level 02 code has the main go to create register number for device module

In Linux, device numbers are used to uniquely identify devices such as hard drives, 
partitions, and other hardware components within the system. 
These device numbers are important for the kernel to manage and interact with these devices.

There are two types of device numbers used in Linux:

    Major Number: It identifies the type of device (e.g., disk, network interface, character device, block device, etc.). 
	Each type of device has its own major number. For example, hard drives typically have a major number associated with 
	block devices, while keyboards and mice have major numbers associated with character devices.

    Minor Number: It helps the kernel differentiate between different devices of the same type. 
	For example, if you have multiple hard drives, each will have a different minor number.

These numbers are used by device drivers to communicate with the kernel and the hardware. 
When a device is connected or detected by the system, the kernel assigns it a unique combination of 
major and minor numbers. These numbers are crucial for the kernel to locate and interact with the 
device when performing tasks such as reading from or writing to it.

You can see the device numbers associated with various devices in the /dev directory in Linux. 
For example, /dev/sda represents the first SCSI/SATA hard disk drive, where "sda" is the name of the 
device and its major and minor numbers are used by the kernel to identify it.

The ls -l command can be used to list the devices in the /dev directory along with their associated major and minor numbers.


        /* register device number*/
        //  The device number to be search at proc/devices will be the name choosen
        //  The name in this case call: my_dev_number
        //  after load, you can check type: cat /proc/devices | grep my_dev_numer

cmd

sudo insmod <fileName.ko>
cat /proc/devices | grep <device named in the code>


sudo knode /dev/mydevice c 90 0


The syntax for mknod is:

bash

sudo mknod /dev/mydevice c major_number minor_number

Here:

    /dev/mydevice is the path and name of the device node you want to create.
    c specifies that you're creating a character device. For block devices, you'd use b.
    major_number and minor_number are the major and minor numbers associated with the device, respectively.

So, your command should look something like:

bash

The syntax for mknod is:

sudo mknod /dev/mydevice c major_number minor_number
sudo mknod /dev/mydevice c 90 0

This command will create a character device node named /dev/mydevice with major number 90 and minor number 0. 
Make sure to replace 90 and 0 with the appropriate major and minor numbers for your device.


ls /dev/mydevice -la
